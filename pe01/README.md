# PE01 - Hello World

# Input
React, Expo, and VS Code. JavaScript and html experience is useful to design the app. GitHub Codespace can also be used as Cloud IDE instead of working on VS Code locally.

The inputs are name, degree program, and school as text. There are three components used: View, Text, and StyleSheet.

# Process
app/index.tsx is the entry point for the mobile app. The View component is used to render the UI or display the data. The data in this case is regular text in the form of 3 Text components, consisting of name, degree program, and school. The StyleSheet is used to design these components, mainly the alignment of the texts, and the background color.

# Output
The output of this mobile app is centered texts of name, degree program, and school, on three separate lines, with the whole background changed to yellow instead of the default white.
